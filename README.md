# Market Basket Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to perform Market Basket Analysis using PySpark, a powerful framework for distributed data processing. Market Basket Analysis is a technique used by retailers to understand the relationships between products that customers tend to buy together. By analyzing these associations, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies, shelf placements, and cross-selling efforts.

In this project, we utilize PySpark to analyze a transactional dataset and generate insights about item associations within customer purchases. The analysis is performed in the `market-basket-analysis.ipynb` notebook.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook `market-basket-analysis.ipynb` is structured as follows:

1. **Environment Setup**: In this section, we set up the PySpark environment, including importing necessary libraries and initializing a Spark session.
2. **Data Loading**: This section involves loading the transactional dataset that contains information about customer purchases. We read the data using PySpark's DataFrame API.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Here, we preprocess the data to ensure it is in the appropriate format for market basket analysis. This might involve transforming the data into a suitable structure (such as a list of transactions) and handling any missing values.
4. **Market Basket Analysis**: The core of the notebook is dedicated to performing the market basket analysis. This involves using the `pyspark.ml.fpm.FPGrowth` module to identify frequent itemsets and association rules from the dataset. The code explains how to set the parameters, fit the model, and extract the results.
5. **Results Interpretation**: After obtaining the association rules, this section focuses on interpreting and presenting the results. We showcase how to extract meaningful insights from the identified item associations.
6. **Visualization**: Visualizations can enhance the understanding of the analysis. This part demonstrates how to create visual representations of the association rules or itemsets, helping to communicate the findings more effectively.
7. **Conclusion**: The notebook concludes with a summary of the key findings from the market basket analysis and discusses potential business applications of these insights.
